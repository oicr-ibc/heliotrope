=head1 NAME

Heliotrope::AnnotationEngine

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Heliotrope::AnnotationEngine;

  my $engine = Heliotrope::AnnotationEngine->new();
  $engine->add_annotation_request("3", 178936082, 178936082, "G", "A", "+");
  $engine->add_annotation_request("12", 25398284, 25398284, "G", "A", "-");

  my $data = $engine->get_annotations();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Abstracts logic for annotations. This allows a more flexible approach with different
annotation tools. It's important we do this, because there may be several components
that generate variant information, and each needs to work consistently.

=head1 NOTES

TBD.
